# CircleCI Snap-in

Snap-in that syncs pipeline, workflow and jobs to DevRev using webhooks.
There is also a command to generate AI insights from the synced data. The insights could be one of the following:
1. Flaky Test Issue Creation (issue_creation)
  1. The command creates an Issue for the Flaky Test.
  2. The issue includes details from the CircleCI API response like test name, classname, file, times flaked, and the workflow and job information.
  3. The AI agent intelligently assigns the issue to the developer most recently associated with the code or test file, streamlining investigation.
2. Intelligent Build Failure Analysis (build_failure_analysis)
  1. Command pulls build logs from CircleCI.
  2. Analyze the logs to identify root causes, error messages, and potential solutions.
  3. AI agent posts a comment on the associated DevRev issue summarizing the analysis and suggesting troubleshooting steps.

### Concept Mapping:
1. CircleCI Project - DevRev Part
2. CircleCI Workflow - DevRev Issue (Each run of the workflow creates a timeline event)
3. CircleCI Job - DevRev Task

To run the command : 
```
/generateInsights pipeline_id command_type
```

## Requirements
1. CircleCI Account API Key
2. CircleCI Project Slug
3. Configuration of CircleCI Outbound Webhook [refer here](https://circleci.com/docs/webhooks/)

## Testing locally

Test the code by adding test events under `src/fixtures` similar to the example event provided. You can add [keyring](https://docs.devrev.ai/snap-ins/references/keyrings) values to the event payload to test API calls as well.

Run local tests using:

```
npm install
npm t
```

## Activating Snap-Ins

Once you are done with the testing, run the following commands to activate your snap_in:

1. Authenticate to devrev CLI
Navigate to the directory with ```manifest.yaml```
```
source .env
echo $DEVREV_TOKEN | devrev profiles set-token --org <org_name> --usr <email>
```

2. Start test server
```
cd ./code
npm run test:server
```
Copy the url generated on replit.

3. Create a snap_in_version

```
devrev snap_in_package create-one --slug <slug_name>
devrev snap_in_version create-one --manifest ./manifest.yaml --testing-url <url>
```

4. Check if the Snap-In has activated
```
devrev snap_in_version show | jq
```

5. Install the Snap-In Draft
```
devrev snap_in draft | jq
```

6. Navigate to the URL returned by the last command on a web browser and setup the required keys.
